# Icon Placeholders

The extension icons should be placed in this directory:
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixel icon
- `icon-96.png` - 96x96 pixel icon

For now, you can use any password manager or lock icon. Ideally:
- Should have a transparent background
- Should clearly represent password management/security
- Common symbols: 🔐 (lock with key), 🔒 (padlock), 🛡️ (shield), or 🗝️ (key)

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator.

## Quick Solution

If you need icons quickly, you can use emoji-to-image converters or create simple colored squares with the 🔐 emoji.
